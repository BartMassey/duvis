.TH DUVIS 1 "2014-03-31"
.SH NAME
duvis \- ASCII visualization of du disk usage information
.SH SYNOPSIS
duvis
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
The
.I duvis
program provides an ASCII visualization of the output of
.IR du (1)
suitable for understanding how storage is being used. The
output of
.I duvis
is the paths that were input, with
only the last component shown except at the root, indented
according to nesting depth, and sorted at each level by
decreasing size, with ties broken alphabetically.
.SH USAGE
.PP
As with
.IR xdu ,
you invoke
.I duvis
on the output of
.IR du ;
currently the
.I du
output is read from standard input, so
either a pipe or a file is fine. The
.I du
output must be
complete, in the sense that every prefix of every path in
the file has an entry (with the exception of the common
prefix that was given to
.IR du );
both relative and absolute
paths work.
